<h1>its just a practice </h1>
<p>after succesfully pushing this practice1 file lets make some 
    changes to this file for further practice</p>
    <h3>now we will create multiple branches</h3>
    <h5>now making changes to remote file of practice1.html and we will clone it , in our local system</h5>
    <h6>now successfully pulled remote file in local system</h6>
    <h7>now will again push this change to remote file</h7>
    <p>its awesome feeling of using github and git </p>
<p>because i am able to successfully clone remote file in our local system </p>
 <p>and making changes to local file and pushing it on remote and pulling the changes made on remote file to local system</p>
<p> now aginn this changes made on remote file , i will pull it on local system , and i will again make changes on locl system 
and push it on remote file , so i will be clear with my practice of using git pull and git push commands , add file , commit file ,
and push it on remote repo</p>
